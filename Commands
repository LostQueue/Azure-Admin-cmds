Create New User
    Powershell " New-AzureADUser "   to delete   " Remove-AzureADUser "
    Azure CLI " az ad user create "  to delete   " az ad user delete "

Bulk Create member users and guests accounts.  You create the comma-separated values (CSV) file with the list of all the users you want to add. An invitation is sent to each user in that CSV file.

    $invitations = import-csv c:\bulkinvite\invitations.csv

    $messageInfo = New-Object Microsoft.Open.MSGraph.Model.InvitedUserMessageInfo

    $messageInfo.customizedMessageBody = "Hello. You are invited to the Contoso organization."

    foreach ($email in $invitations)
       {New-AzureADMSInvitation `
          -InvitedUserEmailAddress $email.InvitedUserEmailAddress `
          -InvitedUserDisplayName $email.Name `
          -InviteRedirectUrl https://myapps.microsoft.com `
          -InvitedUserMessageInfo $messageInfo `
          -SendInvitationMessage $true
       }
       
You can run the New-AzureADUser Azure PowerShell command to add cloud-based users.

    # Create a password object
    $PasswordProfile = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.PasswordProfile

    # Assign the password
    $PasswordProfile.Password = "<Password>"

    # Create the new user
    New-AzureADUser -AccountEnabled $True -DisplayName "Abby Brown" -PasswordProfile $PasswordProfile -MailNickName "AbbyB" -UserPrincipalName "AbbyB@contoso.com"
    
    Azure CLI
    
    az ad user create --display-name "Abby Brown" \
                  --password "<password>" \
                  --user-principal-name "AbbyB@contoso.com" \
                  --force-change-password-next-login true \
                  --mail-nickname "AbbyB"

You can also use Azure PowerShell to add a group using the New-AzureADGroup command as shown below.

    New-AzureADGroup -Description "Marketing" -DisplayName "Marketing" -MailEnabled $false -SecurityEnabled $true -MailNickName "Marketing"

Role Definitons 

    Name 	Description
 Id 	Unique identifier for the role, assigned by Azure.
 IsCustom 	True if a custom role, False if a built-in role.
 Description 	A readable description of the role.
 Actions [] 	Allowed permissions, * indicates all.
 NotActions [] 	Denied permissions.
 DataActions [] 	Specific allowed permissions as applied to data, for example Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/read
 NotDataActions [] 	Specific denied permissions as applied to data.
 AssignableScopes [] 	Scopes where this role applies. / indicates global, but can reach into a hierarchical tree.

    You can tailor the Actions and NotActions properties to grant and deny the exact permissions you need. These properties are always in the format: {Company}.{ProviderName}/{resourceType}/{action}.

As an example, here are the actions for the three roles we looked at previously.
